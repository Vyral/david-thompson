<p style="text-aign: center:"><em>Selling a home requires energy, planning, and avoiding simple mistakes. Here are three such mistakes that you need to steer clear of.</em></p>

**Here are three big mistakes that home sellers tend to make and how you can avoid them:**

**1. Hiring a friend or family member.** I totally understand why people do this. Although it’s someone you know and are comfortable with, selling a home takes much more than just being comfortable. If they are new to the business or don’t do a good job at selling your home, you put yourself in the even more awkward position of having to fire a family member or friend. Base your decision on their experience, not their identity.

**2. Hiring someone that’s inexperienced.** I’ve been selling real estate now for 28 years and have helped thousands of people sell their homes. In real estate transactions, there are always issues. A good agent will take care of those issues and be able to smooth out a transaction, but a new agent won’t know how to do that. Do you want your property to serve as someone’s on-the-job training? Hiring an experienced agent who has the resources to take care of most hiccups will make the transaction much more enjoyable and smooth.

**3. Marketing.** If you’ve ever been to an auction, they are extremely exciting. That’s what marketing a home should be like, too. When homebuyers in the market are excited about your home, it draws energy. When energy comes into the picture, it allows your home to sell quickly and for top dollar. Most agents will simply put your home on the MLS and it will sit on the market and draw no energy. Selling your home quickly and for top dollar requires energy.
