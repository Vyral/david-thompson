When you apply for a loan, there are several important factors that you need to know about.

If you’re applying for a mortgage loan, there are a few factors you need to be aware of that will impact your ability to secure that loan.&nbsp;

The first is which mortgage company you work with. **It’s important to choose a good mortgage company when applying for a loan.** If you give me a call, I can refer you to several of them.&nbsp;

The first thing a good mortgage company will do is get you pre-approved—not pre-qualified. A pre-approval means you’re approved to buy a house—all you have to do afterward is insert the address.&nbsp;

**During the pre-approval process, your lender will look at a couple different aspects of your financial situation.** The first thing they’ll examine is your credit. Obviously, you need decent credit in order to purchase a home, but your lender can help you improve your credit at no extra cost. The next thing they’ll examine is your debt-to-income ratio, in which they compare your debt to your income in order to determine how much home you can afford.

Another factor that impacts your mortgage loan is the home’s appraisal, or how much it’s worth.&nbsp;

It’s also important to remember that different loan programs offer different levels of financing. &nbsp;Rural development and VA loans, for example, offer 100% financing, while FHA loans require you to put 3.5% down.&nbsp;

If you have any more questions about applying for a mortgage loan or you have any other real estate needs at all, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I’d be happy to speak with you.
