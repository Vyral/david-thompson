<p style="text-align: center;"><em>If you’re thinking of buying a home, you should find these four tips on negotiating a successful transaction.</em></p>

Are you planning to buy a home in the near future? If so, then you’ll want to check out the following tips for successfully negotiating a transaction:

**1. Get a good pre-approval from a lender.** There’s a big difference between getting pre-qualified and pre-approved. For pre-qualification, lenders take a superficial glance at your credit and income and tell you, based on that glance, whether or not you’re likely to qualify for a loan. A pre-approval is basically a completed loan package that you have in your hand. If a seller has several offers on the table and a buyer has a loan already approved, they’ll be the prime candidate in the seller’s eyes.

**2. Communicate.** Each seller’s situation is different. Some are looking for top value on the house, and others may be looking for extra time in the house. It’s not always about price. A good buyer’s agent will keep in contact with the listing agent to find out what the seller’s interests are so you can make your offer more enticing to them. With diligent communication, you might also find out about other offers and deals.

**3. Write a great offer.** In my opinion, an offer price shouldn’t be based on the list price. The list price is what the seller would like to sell the home for, but it isn’t necessarily based on what the house is worth. Your agent should take the time to do a proper market analysis to give you an idea of what the other houses in the area have sold for and use that information to come with an offer from a place of knowledge.

**4. Hire a good agent.** For example, I have 28 years of experience and have sold thousands of homes. There are many agents who are still at the beginning of their careers who, frankly, don’t have the experience. It takes a lot of skill to negotiate a great offer, so do your research and hire someone you can trust to get the job done well.

If you have any questions about negotiating or would like to buy a home, please reach out to me. I’d be glad to help you out.
