<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Don’t take Zillow’s word as law when it comes to your home’s value. Here’s what you need to know in order to find out what your home is worth.</em></p>

Everybody knows that you can get an instant value for your home online. But how accurate are these online estimates? That’s what we’re going to look at today.

**Online estimates can be accurate, but they can also be 20% or even 30% off a home’s actual value.** If you’re a home seller, the only way you’re going to find out your home’s true value is by having a professional like myself visit. I can look at your house, look at the things that add value to it, and compare it to the marketplace.

These days, a lot of Realtors are relying on online estimates to give their value to a seller. **I think that’s an injustice.** I went to a house a few weeks ago. One Realtor gave the home a value of $185,000, which is what Zillow valued it at as well. When I came out to the house to take a look, I gave it a value of $220,000. **In the end, we were able to sell that house for over $220,000 in just 3 days.&nbsp;**
