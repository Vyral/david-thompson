<p style="text-align: center;"><em>The length of the home buying process depends on your situation and what your needs are.</em></p>

People ask me all the time, “Dave, how long does the home buying process take?” It all depends on what your situation is and what your needs are. If you’re getting financing, it will typically take longer to buy a home with a government loan than it will with a conventional loan.

VA, FHA, and Rural Development loans typically take about 60 days to close, whereas conventional loans usually only take about 30 days. If you’re paying cash, on the other hand, I can help you close on a home as early as tomorrow. To hear my full message about this topic, watch my latest video.

If you have any more questions about closing on a home or you have any other real estate needs at all, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I’d be happy to speak with you.
