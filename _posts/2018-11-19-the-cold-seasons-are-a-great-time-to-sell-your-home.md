<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Many people shun the idea of selling their home in the fall and winter. That could be a mistake.</em></p>

In my 28 years of selling real estate, one of the most common things I hear from clients is that they’d rather not sell their home in the fall or winter. Most of them want to put it on the market in the spring.

Well, here’s the deal: There are fewer homes on the market in the fall and winter, so per supply and demand, a buyer has fewer options to choose from. But buyers are still looking in the fall; in fact, our numbers are pretty consistent. **People who are transferring into the state for work, etc., usually do so right after Christmas, in January and February.**

Since there will be buyers in the market and they’ll have fewer homes to choose from, you have a better chance of your property selling—and maybe for more money, due to competition from buyers in similar, motivated situations.

In the spring, the market is flooded with real estate, so a buyer will have more to choose from. When they have more options, it means your house has a smaller chance of selling. Even when it does, there isn’t as much pressure from buyers competing with each other, so you might even get less money for your home.

So **ultimately, winter and fall can very well be the best times of year to sell your home.** If you’d like to discuss this in more detail, reach out to me. We can figure out what your home is worth and how it would take to sell.
