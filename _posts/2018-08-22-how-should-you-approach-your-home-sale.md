<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Thinking about selling your home? Here are five tips for success during the process.</em></p>

If you’re thinking about selling your home any time in the near future, here are the steps you need to take in order to have a smooth and successful closing:

**1. Interview a few different agents for the job.** Don’t just hire the first one you talk to. You want to pick the best agent possible. Take your time and do some research. You want to find someone who can get you the highest price for your property in a reasonable time. Doing your research does make a huge difference.

**2. Get your home ready to sell.** Once you hire an agent, they will look at your home from the perspective of a buyer. When you put your home on the market, you want it to appeal to the widest range of buyers possible. This takes an element of skill and expertise.

**3. Price your home properly.** One of the most common questions I hear from home sellers is, “Where should I price my home?” A good agent should be able to prepare research on the other properties on the market and the other properties that have recently sold. That’s a great way to determine what price your home will sell for in this market. In addition to going over the details, it’s also important to determine the best pricing strategy for you to use.

**4. What’s your next move?** If you plan on buying a new home after you sell, we want to get the pre-approval process done so that we know you’re qualified for your next home. It’s important to be proactive about this process.

**5. Bring your home on the market.** This is the final step in getting your home ready for sale. Even before we list it on the MLS and start marketing the home online, we want to create excitement by letting people know the home is coming. That pre-marketing often helps you sell for top dollar.

I’ve been going through this process with sellers for nearly 30 years. If you have any questions about getting your home ready for sale or anything else related to real estate, don’t hesitate to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
